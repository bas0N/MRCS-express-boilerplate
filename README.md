## Introduction
The Sample Router Controller Service is a project designed to provide a centralized routing mechanism for a Node.js and Express based application.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to improve the organization and scalability of the application's routing logic by encapsulating it in a dedicated service.

## Technology Stack

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- Implementation Details

The Router Controller Service utilizes Express to define and handle application routes. It exports a single function that accepts an instance of the Express application and sets up the application's routes using Express' routing APIs.

## Route Organization
In this project, the routes are organized into separate files, with each file representing a feature or module of the application. The Router Controller Service uses the express.Router class to define individual routes and then mounts those routes to the Express application using the app.use() method.

## Conclusion
The Router Controller Service provides a centralized and organized approach to managing application routes in a Node.js and Express based application, improving its scalability and maintainability.
